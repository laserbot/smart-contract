# Laserbot

This uses a "test blockchain", called [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli). To start it, run

    npm run ganache

Then you should deploy the smart contracts to it (this uses Truffle)

    npm run deploy

Then start a webserver to have a look at the app

    npm run dev

Note: for a very minimalistic smart contract setup, see [this commit](https://github.com/laserbot/smart-contract/commit/ec90b7126cb49778b4ef6ee0bd4d21b8715df22b).
